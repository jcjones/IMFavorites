 IMMS Magical Favorites Collector
    a useful tool for filling CDs/DVDs/Mp3 players with
    what IMMS already knows you like.

IMFavorites queries the Intelligent Multimedia Management System database
kept on your system by IMMS to figure out your favorite songs, then symlinks
them to a place of your choice. Read on...

What the?:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've used IMMS for more than a few days, it's already gotten a decent idea
of what kind of music you like and what kind of music you do not like. That
information is stored within its database, dripping with desire to be useful.
This program simply uses that information to find your favorite songs (as IMMS
knows them), and then do the hard work of compiling a CD, DVD or Mp3 player full
of your favorites for you.

What happens is this:
 * IMFavorites accesses the IMMS database in ~/.imms/imms.db
 * IMFavorites gets a list of your favorite songs in order
 * Then one by one symbolic links are made from your songs
   to a directory you specify as a target.
 * This repeats until it links your favorite N songs, or until
   it links your favorite X megabytes of music!

Thus you can get your top 10 songs linked to a directory of your choice, or
your favorite 700 megs of songs for a mp3 CD, or even your favorite 4.7 GB
of songs for a mp3 DVD.

IMFavorites even preserves the pathnames of your painstakingly organized files.
But smartly. An example:

My music is all stored in /mnt/mp3s/, in subdirectories. Let's take one of my
songs as an example:

    /mnt/mp3s/Classical/Wagner-das Ring/01 - Das Rheingold.mp3

IMFavorites will automatically determine that "/mnt/mp3s" is the subdirectory
that contains all your music, and then:
  * "/mnt/mp3s/" is subtracted from the full path of the file
  * the remaining portion is used as the location of the file in your target
    directory.

So, if you have the following command:

    imfavorites {--cd or something} ~/mp3s/favorites/

then

    /mnt/mp3s/Classical/Wagner-das Ring/01 - Das Rheingold.mp3

will be symbolically linked to

    ~/mp3s/favorites/Classical/Wagner-das Ring/01 - Das Rheingold.mp3

automagically! So you get a directory tree like your mp3s directory for your ease
of browsing.

Just point and click. The algorithms are all the same as the above, but it's
pretty.
